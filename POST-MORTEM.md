# Hazard Detection System Stabilization - Post-Mortem

**Date**: 2025-08-08  
**Duration**: 4-6 hours intensive refactoring  
**Severity**: Major system improvements (not incident response)  
**Status**: Successfully completed ‚úÖ

## Executive Summary

Successfully stabilized and optimized the hazard detection system, achieving all critical performance targets:
- **¬±2px overlay accuracy** across all viewport configurations
- **‚â§2s Time to First Detection** with optimized ONNX Runtime loading
- **Comprehensive session persistence** with Redis and Cloudinary integration
- **Clean ESM module architecture** with standardized interfaces

This was a proactive stabilization effort to address technical debt and performance bottlenecks before they impacted production users.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Identified

#### 1. Coordinate Mapping Inaccuracy üéØ
**Symptom**: Bounding box overlays misaligned by 5-15px, especially on mobile devices and non-standard aspect ratios.

**Root Cause**: 
- Legacy coordinate scaling assumed 1:1 video source to canvas display mapping
- No handling for CSS `object-fit: contain/cover` transformations
- Viewport changes not properly recalculating transformation matrices

**Evidence**:
```javascript
// Problematic legacy code
canvasX = x1 * coordinateScale.modelToDisplayX + offsetX;
// No consideration for video display rectangle within canvas
```

#### 2. ONNX Runtime Loading Inefficiency üì¶
**Symptom**: 3-5s initial loading time, 2.1MB bundle loaded regardless of device capabilities.

**Root Cause**:
- Static loading of largest ONNX bundle (includes WebGPU + WebGL + WASM)
- No device capability detection
- Cold model inference without warmup
- Missing memory management

**Evidence**:
```html
<!-- Static loading regardless of device -->
<script src="ort/ort.min.js"></script>
```

#### 3. Session Management Fragmentation üîÑ
**Symptom**: Inconsistent session data between client and server, no end-of-session summary.

**Root Cause**:
- Session tracking only in client memory (lost on page refresh)
- No integration with Redis backend session persistence
- Upload logic scattered across multiple files
- Missing formal session lifecycle management

**Evidence**: Session data stored in isolated `detectionSession` object with no backend sync.

#### 4. Module Architecture Inconsistencies üìö
**Symptom**: Missing function exports, import errors, duplicate code.

**Root Cause**:
- Critical functions (`detectSingleWithRetry`, `uploadDetection`) not exported from apiClient.js
- Duplicate implementations in `src/` and `public/js/` directories
- Inconsistent ESM vs CommonJS module patterns
