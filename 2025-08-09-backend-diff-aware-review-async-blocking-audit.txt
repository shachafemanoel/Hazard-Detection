> Backend — Diff-Aware Review & Async Blocking Audit
  You are Claude Code. I will attach the backend API repo (FastAPI). Perform a
   diff-aware review of recent changes and hunt for bugs and regressions.

  Scope (paths)
  detection.py, external_apis.py, reports.py, sessions.py, health.py

  session_service.py, report_service.py, performance_monitor.py

  app init / __init__.py, plus tests and Dockerfile if present

  Do
  Static audit (async correctness)

  Flag any time.sleep(, requests. inside async def, blocking disk/CPU inside 
  handlers.

  Verify Cloudinary calls run via await asyncio.to_thread(...) or async 
  client.

  Find except: and except Exception: without logging or re-raise. Replace with
   narrow handling and logger.exception.

  Ensure no print( in library code. Logging only.

  Config & health

  Confirm pydantic-settings usage and fail fast on missing required envs.

  /health must return: 
  {"status":"healthy","model_status":"ready|warming|error","version":"..."}. 
  Add if missing.

  Contracts & validation

  Ensure Pydantic models for request/response in reports.py and sessions.py. 
  Validate inputs, return consistent errors.

  Deliver

  One Markdown report BACKEND_REVIEW.md listing issues by file+line with 
  suggested fixes.

  Minimal patch (diff) applying the fixes, with tests if needed.

  Run:

  ruff check ., black --check ., mypy .

  pytest -q

  If failures occur, fix and re-run until green.

⏺ I'll perform a comprehensive diff-aware review of the backend API repo,
  focusing on async correctness, error handling, configuration, and
  validation. Let me start by examining the repository structure and recent
  changes.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Examine repository structure and recent changes             
     ☐ Review detection.py for async correctness and blocking calls
     ☐ Audit external_apis.py for proper async handling
     ☐ Check reports.py for validation and error handling
     ☐ Review sessions.py for async patterns and validation
     ☐ Examine health.py endpoint implementation
     ☐ Audit service files for blocking operations
     ☐ Check app initialization and configuration
     ☐ Run static analysis tools (ruff, black, mypy)
     ☐ Run tests and fix any failures
     ☐ Create BACKEND_REVIEW.md report
     ☐ Generate minimal patch with fixes

⏺ Let me start by examining the repository structure and looking for the
  backend files mentioned in the scope.

⏺ List(.)
  ⎿  Listed 190 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I see this appears to be a frontend-focused repository with both Node.js and
   Python components. Let me look for the backend FastAPI files in the
  structure. I need to check if there's a separate backend directory or if the
   API files are in the api/ directory.

⏺ List(api)
  ⎿  Listed 5 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me check if there are more backend files by looking at the git status
  and examining the API structure more thoroughly.

⏺ Bash(git log --oneline -10)

⏺ Bash(find . -name "*.py" -type f | grep -E
      "(detection|external_apis|reports|sessions|health|service)" | head -20)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> Client — Security & Networking Audit (By Path & Function)
  You are Claude Code. I will attach the client repo. Perform a focused audit 
  and fix.

  Scope (paths)
  public/js/apiClient.js, src/clients/apiClient.js

  public/js/camera_detection.js, public/js/upload.js, public/js/dashboard.js, 
  public/js/map.js

  public/js/onnx-runtime-loader.js, public/app.js

  HTML: public/index.html, public/camera.html, public/dashboard.html, 
  public/upload.html, public/login.html, public/test-api-connection.html

  Checks
  Networking

  Replace raw fetch with fetchWithTimeout(resource, {timeout:10000,...}) + 
  ensureOk(res) + getJsonOrThrow(res).

  Centralize base URL via public/js/config.js exporting BASE_API_URL = 
  window.__CONFIG__?.BASE_API_URL || ''.

  Remove hardcoded http://... endpoints.

  DOM & CSP

  Locate element.innerHTML = dynamic. Replace with textContent or safe DOM 
  builders.

  Remove inline handlers (onclick= etc.).

  Add a strict CSP meta to all listed HTML pages. Allow blob: for media and 
  https: for connect-src. No inline scripts.

  Camera & RAF lifecycle

  Ensure tracks are stopped on teardown: stopStream(stream).

  Ensure RAF loops are cancelable and canceled on stop: stopLoop().

  ORT init

  Deterministic init with ordered EPs and single “model ready” log; graceful 
  fallback if WebGL/WebGPU unavailable.

  Deliver
  CLIENT_REVIEW.md with issues per file+line and the patches.

  Apply fixes and keep UI behavior unchanged.

  Client — Runtime Smoke & Resource-Leak Checks
  You are Claude Code. In the client repo:

  Do
  Add a scripts/smoke-client.md with steps to run a static server and point 
  window.__CONFIG__.BASE_API_URL to the local backend.

  Add a tiny JS harness (or Playwright script) that:

  Loads camera.html, starts detection for 10 seconds, then stops.

  Asserts no unhandled promise rejections, no CSP violations, no increasing 
  media tracks after stop, and that RAF is canceled.

  Calls one API action (/detect or /health) with a fake slow endpoint to 
  verify the fetchWithTimeout aborts.

  Security probe:

  Try rendering a string containing <img src=x onerror=alert(1)> through any 
  remaining UI paths. Verify it is not inserted via innerHTML.

  Deliver
  SMOKE_RESULTS.md with console outputs and findings.

  Fixes as diffs if issues found.

  Integration — End-to-End Validation
  You are Claude Code. Validate client ↔ backend integration.

  Do
  Spin up backend on 127.0.0.1:8000.

  Serve client public/ on 127.0.0.1:8080.

  Set window.__CONFIG__ = { BASE_API_URL: "http://127.0.0.1:8000" } in 
  index.html.

  Perform:

  /health check from UI.

  One detection flow (image upload or camera).

  One report/session flow if available.

  Deliver
  E2E_REPORT.md listing:

  Requests made, status codes, and durations.

  Any CORS/CSP/network errors.

  Screenshots or logs for failures.

  If regressions found, provide targeted diffs by file and function to fix 
  them.

     # Client Security & Networking Audit Report
     ## Executive Summary
     Comprehensive audit of client-side security and networking patterns across
      the Hazard Detection application. The audit covered networking patterns,
     DOM security, CSP implementation, and resource management.
     **Overall Status:** ✅ **GOOD** - Most security measures are properly
     implemented
     **Key Findings:**
     - ✅ Networking patterns are well-implemented with `fetchWithTimeout` and
     proper error handling
