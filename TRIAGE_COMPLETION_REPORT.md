## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### Inference Contract Specification
```typescript
interface DetectionResult {
  detections: Detection[];     // Array of detected objects
  width: number;              // Source image width
  height: number;             // Source image height
  timings: InferenceTimings;  // Performance metrics
  engine: EngineInfo;         // Engine identification
}
```
